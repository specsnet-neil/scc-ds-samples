Repo to hold sample programs for the SCC-DS (Santa Clara County Disaster Survey) project.

Samples are built with python, using pipenv as the addon manager.  To set up your personal environment:

```shell
# these instructions assume you already have pipenv and python3.7 installed and in your path.
pipenv sync     # installs all required packages
pipenv shell    # makes a shell with this virtual environment
```
